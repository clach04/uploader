Uploader by pyther <pyther@pyther.net>

What is Uploader?
Uploader is a simple webpy application that allows users to upload files to a web server
and has support for user authentication. There is support for upload credits and user
expiration dates.

Uploader was created because I needed a simple platform to allow users to upload files
to my web server.

Features:
 -Set User Expiration Date - per user
 -Set upload credits - per user
 -Manage Users Files
 -Users can change their own passwords
 -Add users easily

Installation:
    -Run Locally
       python index.py (http://localhost:8080)
       Not Recommend for daily usage

    -Configure the webserver correctly to use webpy script
    ***Lighttpd Example***
    
    fastcgi.server = ( 
        "/uploader.py" =>
        ((
            "socket" => "/tmp/fastcgi-uploader.tmp",
            "bin-path" => "/home/http/uploader/index.py",
            "max-proc" => 1,
            "bin-environment" => (
                "REAL_SCRIPT_NAME" => "/uploader"
            ),
            "check-local" => "disable"
        ))
        )   
    
    url.rewrite-once = (
        "^/uploader/(.*)$" => "/uploader.py/$1"
    )
            

    -Create Sqlite Database:
        create table sessions (
            session_id char(128) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            atime timestamp NOT NULL default current_timestamp,
            data text
        );
        create table users (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
            password VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
            credits INTEGER,
            exprdate DATETIME,
            usertype CHAR(5) NOT NULL
        );

        # Username: admin, Password: admin, Usertype: admin
        insert INTO 'users' (name, password, usertype) values ('admin', 'tdlasp2ru0PJ6', 'admin');

        To generate the password hash: python -c "import crypt; print crypt.crypt('yourPassword', 'td')"

        Alternatively use the example.db (username: admin, password: admin)

        Rename the database to app.db

    -Configure some simple variables in index.py
        uploadpath = physical path where all uploads will be stored - ex: /srv/http/example.com/uploads/
        uploadurl = the url to access all uploaded files - ex: http://example.com/uploads/

        MaxSize = Maximum Size of uploaded files for users
        MaxSizeAdmin = Maximum Size of uploaded files from Administrators 

Troubleshooting:
    *If you get an error about the database being unable to be read/opened check the permissions and make sure the web server can read/write the database.
